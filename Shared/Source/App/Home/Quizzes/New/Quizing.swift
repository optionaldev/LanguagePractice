   An immutable list of challenge entries. These reflect the baseline for the quiz
   at hand. The actual challenges that are presented to the user are based on the
   entries.
   
   The reason why the actual challenges are not generated at the beginning of the
   quiz is because we might have for example an image that is currently being
   downloaded or in queue to be downloaded and we can't assume it will finish
   by the time the challenge is reached. Instead if we postpone the challenge
   generation, we can simply verify if the image download is finish and if not
   we generate a different type of challenge for that word.

   For someone that grinds all day, his version of a challenge being completed
   might be in under 2 seconds even for a long word. For someone that casually
   uses the app for 10 minutes a week, even 10 seconds might be within expectations.
