   quiz is because we might have for example an image that is currently being
   downloaded or in queue to be downloaded and we can't assume it will finish
   by the time the challenge is reached. Instead if we postpone the challenge
   generation, we can simply verify if the image download is finish and if not
   we generate a different type of challenge for that word.
